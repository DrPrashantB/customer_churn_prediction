Customer Churn Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques. Customer churn is when customers stop doing business with a company. By predicting churn, businesses can take proactive steps to retain customers. The dataset used contains customer information, and the project employs various machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn.
Project Structure

The notebook is organized into the following sections:

    Introduction and Data Loading
    Data Preprocessing
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    Model Training and Evaluation
    Model Improvement

1. Introduction and Data Loading
Libraries and Packages

The project makes use of several key libraries:

    pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
    numpy: For numerical operations.
    matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
    scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.

Data Loading

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame. The dataset includes various customer attributes such as:

    CustomerID
    Gender
    SeniorCitizen
    Partner
    Dependents
    Tenure
    PhoneService
    MultipleLines
    InternetService
    OnlineSecurity
    OnlineBackup
    DeviceProtection
    TechSupport
    StreamingTV
    StreamingMovies
    Contract
    PaperlessBilling
    PaymentMethod
    MonthlyCharges
    TotalCharges
    Churn

2. Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis. The main steps include:

    Handling Missing Values: Dropping or imputing missing values to ensure data integrity.
    Converting Categorical Variables: Mapping categorical variables to numerical values for model compatibility.
    Feature Scaling: Scaling numerical features to standardize the data.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA helps in understanding the data and uncovering patterns. Key steps include:
Distribution of Churn

Visualizing the distribution of churn to understand the proportion of customers who have churned versus those who have not.
Correlation Matrix

Creating a correlation matrix to examine the relationships between different features. This helps in identifying features that might be highly correlated and can influence the model's performance.
4. Model Training and Evaluation
Train-Test Split

The dataset is split into training and testing sets. This is essential for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.
Random Forest Classifier

A Random Forest classifier is used to predict customer churn. The model is trained on the training data and evaluated on the test data. The evaluation metrics include:

    Confusion Matrix: Provides a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
    Accuracy Score: Measures the overall accuracy of the model.

5. Model Improvement
Adding Features

Additional features are introduced to see if they improve the model's performance. The steps include:

    Selecting New Features: Identifying and including new features that might have predictive power.
    Re-training the Model: Training the model with the new set of features.
    Re-evaluating the Model: Assessing the model's performance with the new features using the same evaluation metrics.

Conclusion

The project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a machine learning model to predict customer churn. It covers data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, evaluation, and improvement. By following these steps, businesses can develop predictive models to identify potential churn and take necessary actions to retain customers.
