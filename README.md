1. Introduction

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using various machine learning models. The dataset consists of customer information, and the goal is to determine which customers are likely to churn based on the given features. The notebook is divided into sections for data manipulation, visualization, and different machine learning techniques.

2. Data Manipulation

This section involves cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. Steps typically include:

    Handling missing values.
    Encoding categorical variables.
    Normalizing or standardizing the data.

3. Data Visualization

Visualization is used to understand the data better and identify any patterns or trends. Common visualizations might include:

    Histograms and bar charts.
    Scatter plots.
    Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

4. Machine Learning with Neural Network
<a name="data-prediction-using-linear-regression"></a>C1. Data Prediction using Linear Regression

Linear Regression is a simple yet powerful model for predicting continuous values. In the context of churn prediction, it might be used to predict a score indicating the likelihood of churn.
<a name="data-prediction-using-logistic-regression"></a>C2. Data Prediction using Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is suitable for binary classification problems like churn prediction. It outputs probabilities indicating whether a customer will churn or not.
<a name="data-prediction-using-multiple-logistic-regression"></a>C3. Data Prediction using Multiple-Logistic Regression

Multiple Logistic Regression extends the logistic regression model to consider multiple input features for predicting churn.
<a name="data-prediction-using-decision-tree"></a>C4. Data Prediction using Decision Tree

Decision Trees are intuitive models that split the data based on feature values to make predictions. They are useful for understanding feature importance and interactions.
<a name="data-prediction-using-random-forest"></a>C5. Data Prediction using Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.
Detailed Sections and Code
2. Data Manipulation

The data manipulation section includes code for loading the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
3. Data Visualization

Visualizations are created using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the data. This section includes code for generating various plots and interpreting the results.
4. Machine Learning Models

Each machine learning model section includes the following:

    Model Initialization: Code for initializing the model.
    Training the Model: Code for fitting the model to the training data.
    Model Evaluation: Code for evaluating the model's performance on the test data using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    Prediction: Code for making predictions on new data.
